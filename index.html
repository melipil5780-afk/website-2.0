                <p>We swim in stories every day without realizing it. The cultural narratives that surround us—about success, relationships, mental health, and what makes a life worth living—seep into our personal understanding so quietly that we often mistake them for universal truths. But these dominant stories aren't neutral. Many actively harm our ability to understand ourselves and create authentic lives.</p>
                <p>Narrative therapy recognizes that the stories we absorb from our culture become the lens through which we interpret our own experiences. When these cultural stories are limiting or damaging, they can trap us in versions of ourselves that feel foreign and painful. Learning to separate cultural fiction from personal truth becomes essential work for anyone seeking genuine healing and growth.</p>

            <h2 class="reveal">The stories that shape us</h2>
            <section class="reveal">
                <p>Cultural narratives operate like background music—always playing, rarely noticed, but profoundly influential. These stories tell us what emotions are acceptable, what life paths have value, and how we should measure our worth. They whisper that anxiety means weakness, that asking for help signals failure, that feeling deeply makes us "too sensitive."</p>
                <p>Research in narrative therapy shows that many psychological struggles stem not from individual pathology but from the harmful stories our culture tells about normal human experiences. When someone feels ashamed of their hurt feelings, they're often responding to cultural messages that emotions should be controlled, minimized, or overcome rather than understood and honored.</p>
                <p>The most damaging cultural stories are often the ones that feel most "obvious" or "natural." They've been repeated so frequently that questioning them feels almost rebellious...</p>

            <div class="pull-quote reveal" style="--order: 1;">
                Your hurt feelings don't need to be minimized to fit cultural comfort levels—they can be understood as important information about your experience that deserves attention and care.

                <!-- (Continuing with your full text – abbreviated here for brevity) -->
                <p>These internalized cultural stories don't just influence our choices—they become the framework through which we understand our entire identity...</p>

                <p>Challenging cultural narratives isn't about rejecting all social structure...</p>

                <p>One of the most challenging aspects of this work...</p>

                <p>When you begin living from your authentic narrative...</p>
                
                <p>Your story matters exactly as it is. The cultural narratives that don't serve you don't deserve your allegiance simply because they're familiar or popular. Your authentic experience is valid data about reality, and trusting it becomes an act of both personal healing and quiet cultural revolution.</p>
